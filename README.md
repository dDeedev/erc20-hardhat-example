# Sample Hardhat Project

## Solidity
## Hardhat
## Etherjs
## Web3js 


This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```

Try to query the contract:

```shell
npx hardhat run scripts/query/queryUnwrap.ts --network sixnet
```# erc20-hardhat-example
